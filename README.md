# A minimal Next.js site with Sanity Studio

This starter is a statically generated site that uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content.
It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing.

The Studio connects to Sanity Content Lake, which gives you hosted content APIs with a flexible query language, on-demand image transformations, powerful patching, and more.
You can use this starter to kick-start a clean slate site or learn these technologies.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
